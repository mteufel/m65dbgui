TITLE
DESCRIPTION


Example:
imm
immediate 8-bit
Immediate Mode
In this mode, the argument to the instruction is a value that is used directly.
This is indicated by proceeding the value with a # character. Most assemblers allow
values to be entered in decimal, or in hexadecimal by preceding the value with a $ sign,
in binary, by preceding the value with a % sign. For example, to set the Accumulator
Register to the value 5, you could use the following:

LDA #5

The immediate argument is encoded as a single byte following the instruction.  For the above
case, the instruction stream would contain $A9, the opcode for LDA immediate mode, followed
by $05, the immediate operand.
