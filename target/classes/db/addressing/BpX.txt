Base-Page X-Indexed Mode
This mode is identical to Base-Page Mode, except that the address is formed by taking
the argument, and adding the value of the X Register to it. In 6502 mode, the result
will always be in the Base-Page, that is, any carry due to the addition from the low
byte into the high byte of the address will be ignored. The encoding for this addressing
mode is identical to Base-Page Mode.
The argument is encoded as a single byte that immediately follows the instruction
opcode. For example,

LDA $12 , X

would read the value stored in location ($12 + X) in the Base-Page, and put it into the
A register. The instruction byte stream for this would be $B5 $12.
See the note on page H-5 for more information about Base-Page and Zero-Page.
