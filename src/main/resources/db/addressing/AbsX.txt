Absolute X-Indexed Mode
This mode is identical to Absolute Mode, except that the address is formed by taking
the argument, and adding the value of the X Register to it. If the indexing causes the
address to cross a page boundary, i.e., if the upper byte of the address changes, this
may incur a 1 cycle penalty, depending on the processor mode and speed setting.
The encoding for this addressing mode is identical to Absolute Mode. For example,
the instruction

LDA $1234 , X

would read the memory location ($1234 + X), and place the value read from there
into the A Register. This would be encoded as $BD $34 $12.
