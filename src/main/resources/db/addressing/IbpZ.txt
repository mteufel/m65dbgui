Base-Page Indirect Z-Indexed Mode
This addressing mode differs from the X-Indexed Indirect modes, in that the Z Regis-
ter is added to the address that is read from the pointer, instead of being added to
the pointer. This is a very useful mode, that is frequently used because it effectively
provides access to “the Z-th byte of the memory at the address pointed to by the
operand.” That is, it de-references a pointer. The encoding for this addressing mode
is identical to Base-Page Mode.

For example, if the Z Register contains the value $04, and the memory locations $12
and $13 in the current Base-Page contained $78 and $56, respectively, then

LDA ( $12 ) , Z

would read the contents of memory location $567C (i.e., $5678 + Z), and store the
result in the A register. This instruction would be encoded as $B2 $12.
That is, it is equivalent to the Base-Page Indirect Y-Indexed Mode, but using the Z
register instead of the Y register to calculate the offset.
