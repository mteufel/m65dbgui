bpiX
(indirect,X)
Base-Page Indirect X-Indexed Mode
This addressing mode is identical to Absolute Indirect X-Indexed Mode, except that the
address of the pointer is formed from the Base-Page Register (high byte) and the 8-bit
operand (low byte). The encoding for this addressing mode is identical to Base-Page
Mode.
For example, if the X Register contains the value $04, and the memory locations $16
and $17 in the current Base-Page contained $34 and $12, respectively, then

LDA ( $12 , X )

would read the contents of memory location $1234, and store the result in the A
register. This instruction would be encoded as $A1 $12.
