indX
(indirect,X)
Absolute Indirect X-Indexed Mode
In this mode, the 16-bit argument is the address that points to, i.e., contains the ad-
dress of actual byte to read. It is identical to Absolute Indirect Mode, except that the
value of the X Register is added to the pointer address. For example, if the X Register
contains the value $04, memory location $1238 contains $78 and memory location
$1239 contains $56, then

JMP ( $1234 , X )

would jump to address $5678. The encoding for this addressing mode is identical to
Absolute Mode, and thus this instruction would be encoded as $7C $34 $12.
