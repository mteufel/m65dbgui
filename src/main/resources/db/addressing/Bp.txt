Base-Page Mode
In this mode, the argument is an 8-bit address. The upper 8-bits of the address are
taken from the Base-Page Register. On 6502 processors, there is no Base-Page Reg-
ister, and instead, the upper 8-bits are always set to zero – hence the name of this
mode on the 6502: Zero-Page. On the 45GS02, it is possible to move this “Zero-
Page” to any page in the processor’s 64KB view of memory by setting the Base-Page
Register using the TAB instruction. Base-Page Mode allows faster access to a 256 re-
gion of memory, and uses less instruction bytes to do so.
The argument is encoded as a single byte that immediately follows the instruction
opcode. For example,

LDA $12

would read the value stored in location $12 in the Base-Page, and put it into the
Accumulator Register. The instruction byte stream for this would be $85 $12.
