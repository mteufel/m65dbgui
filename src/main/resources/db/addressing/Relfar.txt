Relative Word Addressing Mode
This addressing mode is identical to Relative Addressing Mode, except that the ad-
dress offset is a 16-bit value. This allows a relative branch or jump to any location in
the current 64KB memory view. This makes it possible to write software that is fully
relocatable, by avoiding the need for absolute addresses when calling routines.

For example,

BNE $3000

would jump to $3000 if the Z flag of the process was not set. If this instruction were
located at address $2002, it would be encoded as $D3 $FC $0F, i.e., branching to
+$FFC = 4,092 bytes following the second byte of the instruction. The fact that the
instruction is 3 bytes long is ignored in this calculation.
