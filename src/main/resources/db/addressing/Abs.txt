Absolute Mode
In this mode, the argument is an 16-bit address. The low 8-bits of the address are
taken from the byte immediately following the instruction opcode. The upper 8-bits
are taken from the byte following that. For example, the instruction

LDA $1234

would read the memory location $1234, and place the read value into the Accumu-
lator Register. This would be encoded as $AD $34 $12.
