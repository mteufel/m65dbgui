ind
(indirect)
Absolute Indirect Mode
In this mode, the 16-bit argument is the address that points to, i.e., contains the ad-
dress of actual byte to read. For example, if memory location $1234 contains $78
and memory location $1235 contains $56, then

JMP ( $1234 )

would jump to address $5678. The encoding for this addressing mode is identical to
Absolute Mode, and thus this instruction would be encoded as $6C $34 $12.
