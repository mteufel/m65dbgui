Relative Addressing Mode
In this addressing mode, the operand is an 8-bit signed offset to the current value of
the Program Counter (PC). It is used to allow branches to encode the nearby address
at which execution should proceed if the branch is taken.

For example,

BNE $2003

would jump to $2003, if the Z flag of the processor was not set. If this instruction
were located at address $2000, it would be encoded as $D0 $01, i.e., branching
to +1 bytes after the PC. Branch offsets greater than $7F branch backwards, with
$FD branching to the byte immediately preceeding the branch instruction, and lower
values branching progressively further back. In this way, a branch can effectively be
made between -125 and +127 bytes from the opcode byte of the branch instruction.
For longer branches, the 45GS02 supports Relative Word Addressing Mode, where
the offset is encoded using 2 bytes instead of 1.
